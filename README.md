# tps-js-jr-interview
Junior Reactjs Developer Interview Repository

### `npm i`
Installs necessary dependencies. Should only need to be run once when the repo is first cloned.

### `npm run start`
Starts the web server and runs on localhost:3000. \
Hot reloads so Refresh is not necessary.

### `npm run test`
Runs the tests. The connection stays alive similar to a hot reload.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
